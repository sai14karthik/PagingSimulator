    <p>
      Paging is a memory management scheme used in modern operating systems to handle memory allocation and access. It provides a way to divide the physical memory into fixed-size blocks called "pages," and the logical memory into blocks of the same size called "page frames." Each process is divided into equal-sized chunks called "pages," which are mapped to available page frames in physical memory.
    </p>

    <p>
      When a process needs to access a specific memory address, the operating system translates the virtual address into a physical address using a page table. The page table keeps track of the mapping between virtual pages and physical page frames. If the required page is not currently present in physical memory, a process called "page fault" occurs, and the operating system fetches the required page from secondary storage (such as a hard disk) into an available page frame in memory.
    </p>

    <p>
      Paging provides several advantages, including:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Allows efficient memory allocation and management by dividing memory into fixed-size blocks</li>
      <li>Enables each process to have its own virtual address space, independent of the actual physical memory</li>
      <li>Allows for easy sharing of memory between processes</li>
      <li>Enables the use of virtual memory, which allows processes to use more memory than physically available</li>
      <li>Provides protection between processes by assigning different page tables and restricting access to specific pages</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Paging is a fundamental concept in modern operating systems and plays a crucial role in managing memory efficiently. Understanding how paging works is essential for developers and system administrators to optimize memory usage and improve overall system performance.

      Features of paging:
      <br>

Mapping logical address to physical address.
<br>
Page size is equal to frame size.
<br>
Number of entries in a page table is equal to number of pages in logical address space.
<br>
The page table entry contains the frame number.
<br>
All the page table of the processes are placed in main memory.
